# Object-Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications  

## Overview  
This repository contains my coursework, programming assignments, and projects from **CMPSC 221: Object-Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications** at **Penn State University**.  
The course focused on applying advanced object-oriented programming principles to **web-based, client/server systems**, emphasizing software design, data communication, and secure web development using **Java**.  

Throughout the course, I developed both **client-side** and **server-side** programs, learning how to design modular, event-driven applications that interact with databases and network resources.

## Repository Contents  
- **Programming Assignments**  
  - Object-oriented Java applications showcasing inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.  
  - GUI-based programs built with **JavaFX** and **Swing** for interactive interfaces.  
  - Server-client applications utilizing **sockets**, **HTTP communication**, and **multithreading**.  
  - Database-driven applications using **JDBC** to perform SQL queries and data persistence.  

- **Final Project**  
  - A complete **web-based client/server system** integrating authentication, GUI interaction, and database management.  
  - Included system design with UML diagrams, code implementation, documentation, and testing.  

- **Reference Material**  
  - Notes on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, intermediate bytecode generation, and class loaders.  
  - Examples of **secure file management**, user permissions, and data protection for client/server systems.
